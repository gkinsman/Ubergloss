Introduction
This is a class I wrote for a project in my fourth semester of my degree. We were given a term/definition website which was like a dictionary, but more about the words' meanings in different countries. It was written in with Java servlets and JSP, and we had to use "agile processes", to improve it and do our own thing. 

Goal
One of our focuses for the project was meaningful search. For the first release we had a Levenshtein distance search for terms, and our final release had an attribute system which allowed users to be more expressive in their searching.

Ubergloss Attribute Language (UAL)
[tag]
(locale)
term
"definition"

Samples searches:
"[internet] (en-US)" - Definitions fom the (US locale) [tagged with internet]
""science" (gb-UK)"  - Definitions "containing the word science" (from the UK)


Locales
Terms can have different definitions in each locale. By tagging different definitions with different locales, it's possible to filter results by them.

Tags
Each definition can be tagged with n tags. The tagging system allows each tag to have a single parent but many children, aka a tree. This allows us to group and categorise definitions automatically, and with interesting results.

This code is untouched from when it was handed in. I may post the rest of the codebase in the future. Or I may not.


Note: I understand that this class is made obsolete by modern OR/Ms and databases with built in search, however we only needed something quick for a demo and learning a new tool was a might-have.
